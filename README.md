# PageTurn  

PageTurn is a letterboxd-like web application for books that showcases my journey in improving my frontend skills and gaining in-depth knowledge of the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js). This project has provided me with hands-on experience in building modern web applications and managing databases.


Throughout this project, I have focused on improving my frontend development skills. I have implemented responsive and visually appealing user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and Angular framework. The project has allowed me to explore various frontend concepts and best practices, including UI design, component architecture, and data binding.

I have gained a comprehensive understanding of the MEAN stack, which comprises MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js. By working on this project, I have learned how to integrate these technologies to build robust and scalable web applications. I have acquired proficiency in handling data storage, server-side logic, API development, and client-side rendering using this powerful stack.

A significant aspect of this project has been focused on database management. Specifically, I have gained expertise in MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database used in MEAN stack development. I have learned to design database schemas, interact with MongoDB using Mongoose (an Object-Data Mapping library), and perform CRUD operations. Additionally, I have explored advanced database concepts such as indexing, querying, and data aggregation.
